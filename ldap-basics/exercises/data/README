This directory contains data and scripts to generate test files for
directory servers.

generate.pl	Script to generate lists of names in plain or LDIF form.
		usage:
		./generate.pl [-P] [number] [Org DN] [mail domain]

		-P causes Posix account information to be generated

given-names	Input data for generate.pl
surnames

names.ldif	Sample generated LDIF file

names		List of the names found in the LDIF file (NOTE: not all unique)

extract-surnames.pl
		Script to extract surnames from a list of input names
		(very simple-mainded)

extract-given.pl
		Script to extract given names from a list of input names
		(very simple-mainded)

The source data is based on a list of university computer users
in 1987. It is impossible to identify the original people from the data
here, but the generated names should have similar statistical properties
to the original set. No attempt has been made to match surnames and
given names culturally, so some unlikely combinations will show up in
the output!
