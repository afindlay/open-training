Creating SSL keys for OpenLDAP
==============================

First make the Certificate Authority (only need to do this ONCE):

  openssl genrsa -aes128 -out ca.key 2048

	Set the passphrase for the CA key to 'secret'

  openssl req -new -x509 -days 8000 -key ca.key -out ca.cert -config openssl.cnf -extensions v3_ca

	Fill in the fields as appropriate - not much is critical here
	but the CN (Common Name) should be something like 'Master CA'

Useful info comes from these:

  openssl x509 -in ca.cert -noout -hash
  openssl x509 -in ca.cert -noout -text

Now make a key for the LDAP servers:

  openssl genrsa -out ldap.key 2048

	Note that this key is not encrypted so it must be protected by file permissions

Generate a Certificate Signing Request:

  openssl req -new -sha256 -key ldap.key -out ldap.csr -config openssl.cnf

	The Common Name field should be 'ldap.example.org'
	Several alternative names are specified in the v3_req clause of the config file.

Sign the certificate using the CA key:

  openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in ldap.csr -out ldap.cert -CA ca.cert -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 7999 -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req

Check the certificate:

  openssl x509 -in ldap.cert -noout -text
