LDAP Basics class

Open Source Open Training

A half-day hands-on introduction to LDAP and Directory Server concepts.
This class is designed to be used by an instructor who knows LDAP well.
Practical sessions use Linux images running in the cloud and accessed
with SSH and/or VNC.

The kit contains:
	Slides and notes
	Exercise guide
	Exercise setup files
	Instructor notes

The slides, notes and exercise guide are set up to produce an A4 booklet.
Many commercial print services will accept the PDFs.

Roughly, this means that you can use it to give courses and you can
modify it and distribute the modified version. You must give credit to
the original author and any other contributors, you must apply the same
