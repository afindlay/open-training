Setup notes for LDAP Basics class

This is intended as a very fast intro to LDAP, not to a specific server
so much of the config must be already in place at the start of the class.

Student machine images should be based on a Linux desktop setup,
configured to bring up a desktop ready for VNC access.

Build OpenLDAP from source and install it in /usr/local (or install from
the Linux Tool Box package perhaps).

Fix /etc/hosts so that ldap1.example.org is on loopback

Install Apache Directory Studio and link it into ~/bin as 'studio'

NOTE: don't use the smallest AWS instance. 1GB RAM is not enough
for Apache Directory Studio!
