LDAP Basics class documents

Note that the document files have embedded fonts so they should work on any machine.
Make sure that the PDF is generated as PDF/A.1 (use File->Export as PDF...
rather than the PDF icon in the toolbar). This will embed the fonts, which
is essential for commercial printing.

Slides for projection and notes that go with them in the printed material.
OpenOffice/LibreOffice document.

ldap-basics-slides.odt
	This generates:

	ldap-basics-notes.pdf
	ldap-basics-outline.txt
	ldap-basics-slides.pdf

Instructions for practical exercises:
OpenOffice/LibreOffice document.

ldap-basics-exercises.odt
	This generates:

	ldap-basics-exercises.pdf

Cover for printed material:
Scribus document, set up for full bleed on an A4 saddle-stitched (stapled) booklet.
When generating PDF, make sure you embed all fonts.

ldap-basics-cover.sla
	This generates:

	ldap-basics-cover.pdf

The PDFs should work on most commercial print services.
Some (e.g. Lulu) will allow you to supply several PDFs for the inside pages.
Others may limit you to one PDF for the cover and one for the main pages;
in that case if you want notes and exercises in the same printed book you
will need to join the files with a tool like pdfunite (from the poppler-tools package):
	pdfunite ldap-basics-notes.pdf ldap-basics-exercises.pdf all.pdf

You can order a printed copy of the finished book here:
